- check that cf7 is installed, bail out otherwise
-
- custom post type to keep track of CF7 forms and their mapped posts
- create a custom post type based on the form ID
  + the post factory class creates + registers custom post dynamically. This needs to be hooked on 'init'
  + need to create one more custom post which sole purpose if to keep track of all the mapped post types.
- hook on post_type wpcf7_contact_form delete and delete the corresponding post_type for that Form
  + add mapped post id the cf7 post meta fields
- skip mail setting in post creation page
- store all mapping post type settings directly into the cf7 post
- set menu_icon in post mapping page (http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type)
- map to an existing post type. Need to by pass post factory and check that the post exists, then map all the properties and taxonomies
- when posty_type is changed on form, if system post, re-load form, else we need to keep track of all the filters in use on the select and modify their values.
- meta fields created need to have spaces replaced with underscore + msg flashed
DONE
- add filter for meta capabilities in factory class (http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/108338/capabilities-and-custom-post-types)
